# Some notes for a basic `R` analysis

ds 2024-02-23 - started

- link to qualtrics <https://nottinghampsych.eu.qualtrics.com/>
- this code and sample survey data shows you some pointers on how to get off the ground with `RStudio` and `R` with the survey data.

## Ideas for descriptive stats

- bar plots (eg gender distribution), histograms (ages), ...
- boxplots - showing range, interquartiles, etc.
- scatter plots (one score versus another)

To show what the actual data / responses look like.

Have a look at [`example_analysis.R`](./example_analysis.R) to get a sense of what's involved... I will update comments, improve docs, as we go along.

## Links

- RStudio – for data analysis (very useful, not a must)
- RStudio is an environment for using “R”, which is a multipurpose programming language (don’t be scared by that general idea!) for dealing with data, doing stats, datascience, making beautiful plots.
[link to download](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). As of 2024/25 it is installed in the computer labs in Psych, so maybe have a play there first, although download and install is pretty easy.
- R for Data Science (R4DS) https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ - really excellent free book with some tutorial content tha allow you to work through some examples. Well worth the effort to go through first couple of chapters.
- R data science tutorials- [A youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3x6DOfs2NGglHEO3WBEaxiEZ0_ZiwZJi&si=2JseXRlFCumJ4IRm) of a group of people working through the material – haven't gone through this myself, but looks like worth a go!
